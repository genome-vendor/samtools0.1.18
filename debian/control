Description: processing sequence alignments in SAM and BAM formats
 Samtools is a set of utilities that manipulate nucleotide sequence alignments
 in the binary BAM format. It imports from and exports to the ascii SAM
 (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, does sorting, merging and indexing, and allows
 to retrieve reads in any regions swiftly. It is designed to work on a stream,
 and is able to open a BAM (not SAM) file on a remote FTP or HTTP server.

Description: manipulates nucleotide sequence alignments in BAM or SAM format 
 The BAM library provides I/O and various operations on manipulating nucleotide
 sequence alignments in the BAM (Binary Alignment/Mapping) or SAM (Sequence
 Alignment/Map) format. It now supports importing from or exporting to SAM,
 sorting, merging, generating pileup, and quickly retrieval of reads overlapped
 with a specified region.
